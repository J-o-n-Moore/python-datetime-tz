datetime_tz module
===============================================================================

A version of the python-datetime module which deeply cares about timezone
(instead of ignoring the problem). The module automatically detects your
current timezone using a variety of different methods.

The module also includes extra functionality;

    * Partial parsing support (IE 2006/02/30 matches %Y/%M/%D %H:%M)
    * Full integration with pytz (just give it the string of the timezone!)
    * Proper support for going to/from Unix timestamps (which are in UTC!).
